# PerlCourse

A few perl scripts to use for learning purposes

If you run on Mac Os, and any of it's variants, you already have perl in your computer. If you run windows, you will probably have to install perl. If you run Linux, then what the #ffffff you are doing here?

In any case, if you need to install Perl, you should head into perl.org, actually this link:

http://learn.perl.org/installing/

It is highly recommendable to read Perl's wikipedia and follow on the Tutorial in 2). If you are anxious about programming in perl, then hit directly the scripts in this repo and do it yourself :)

In general, you should be able to execute each of these programs by opening a terminal, and executing the following command, ie:

username# perl first_programm
